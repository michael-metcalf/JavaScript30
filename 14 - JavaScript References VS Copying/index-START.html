    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100, the value of 'age2' is whatever the value of 'age' was AT THE TIME OF ASSIGNMENT
    // it's okay to change the original 'age'; it won't update 'age2'

    let name = 'Mike';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Mike Mike
    name = 'Cool';
    console.log(name, name2); // Cool Mike
    // it's okay to change 'name'; it won't update 'name2'

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
 
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux'; // this updates the original 'players' array
    console.log(team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // 'team' is NOT an array, it's a REFERENCE to the original array 'players'
    // edits made to 'team' will go back to 'players'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // an empty .slice() will make a copy of the array it's called on
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team2); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or use the Array.from() method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person); // person.number now equals 99; 'captain' was merely a REFERENCE to 'person'

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // use Object.assign
    // first, start with a blank object {}, then pass in the object you wish to copy, 
    // then fold in the new properties/values you wish to overwrite,
    // then stick all that into its own variable
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const mike = {
      name: 'Mike',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@pancaketaicho',
        facebook: 'michaelmetcalf'
      }
    }

    // these only copy the first level of an object (a shallow copy), not deeper levels (like 'social')
    const mike2 = {...mike};
    const mike3 = Object.assign({}, mike);

    // you usually don't have to do a deep clone of an object, though. if you do, however...

    // poor man's deep copy:
    // JSON.stringify the obj you want to copy to turn it into a string and shake all references to the original obj,
    // then JSON.parse that back into an obj, giving you a clean copy of the original
    const mike4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mike));
